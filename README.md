# DepressionDetectionUsingAI
This project uses machine learning to detect depression from EEG data. By applying various algorithms (e.g., DecisionTreeClassifier, SVM, Random Forest, etc.), it aims to identify neurophysiological patterns associated with depression. The results show promising accuracy, enhancing early and accurate diagnosis.
